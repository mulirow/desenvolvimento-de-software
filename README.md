## 💾 Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mulirow/desenvolvimento-de-software.git
    cd desenvolvimento-de-software
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add the necessary environment variables:

        ```
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        GOOGLEAI_API_KEY==your_google_ai_api_key
        LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=your_liveblocks_secret_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_liveblocks_public_key
        ```

## ⚡ Usage Instructions

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your terminal).

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing.

1.  **Install Cypress dependencies (if not already installed):**

    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

2.  **Run Cypress:**

    You can run Cypress in different modes:

    *   **Open Cypress UI:** This opens the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to run tests interactively.
        ```bash
        npm run cypress:open
        ```

    *   **Run Cypress in headless mode (for CI/CD):** This runs the tests in the command line without a UI.
        ```bash
        npm run cypress:run
        ```

3.  **Writing Tests:**

    Cypress tests are located in the `cypress` directory.  Refer to the Cypress documentation for guidance on writing tests: [https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)
